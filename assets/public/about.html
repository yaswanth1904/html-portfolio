Mountains are large landforms that rise above the surrounding land, usually in the form of a peak. They are <br>
 formed through tectonic forces, volcanism, or erosion over millions of years. Tectonic plates can collide and push up rock, while magma from <br> 
 volcanoes can harden into layers to create mountains</p></h3>
